Your first real-world project is always nerve-wracking, not because of the code, but because of everything *around* it. I realized that when I accepted my **first freelance project after graduation**: building a website for a school : **from scratch**.

At first, I was confident.  
_"It’s just a website,"_ I told myself. Among all the projects I had done during college, web development was always the most enjoyable. I designed the layout in just **three days**, using a professional template for speed.

But what made this project *tricky* wasn’t the coding , it was the client.  
In this case, my very first client was someone close to me, someone with **little to no knowledge of tech** or websites. And when I asked them what features they wanted, they simply replied:  
> “Just make whatever you think is good.”

Wait — what?

#### 🎯 Designing Without Direction

It’s incredibly difficult to build something when your client doesn’t know what they want. Sure, I was given creative freedom… but at what cost?

I spent **months** , not writing code, but imagining the *concept* of the website. What kind of data should be shown on a school site? What kind of structure would users expect? What features are essential?

And to make things more interesting, I didn’t even have the data.  
I had to collect it **manually** by reaching out to the teachers and staff one by one. So at first, I worked with **dummy data** and placeholders.

Whenever I tried to ask for feedback on the features I built, the client would say,  
> “Just finish the whole thing first, then I’ll take a look.”  
That’s not how development works, at least not if you want to avoid rework.

Eventually, I *insisted* on walking them through each feature, explaining everything so we could agree before development moved too far ahead.


#### 🛠 Backend, Hosting, and the SEO Realization

Once we finalized the design, I built the **backend in just one week**. But then it hit me:

> "What’s the point of hosting a website if it can’t be found on search engines?"

That led me to my **next learning milestone: SEO**, something never covered in any of my college courses. I only stumbled upon it thanks to a random Instagram Reel about how websites get indexed by Google.

And just like that, I dove into the world of **manual SEO**:
- I added meta tags,
- Improved page speed,
- Structured headings properly,
- Crafted meaningful keywords for Google Search Console.

I didn’t have the budget (or client approval) to hire an SEO agency, so I had to **trust my process and instincts**. I followed every best practice I could find, knowing that the results wouldn’t come instantly.


#### ⚡ Final Result

Eventually, I launched the site on live hosting, reviewed all functionalities, and made sure everything worked as expected. And then I waited.

Weeks passed. Then months.

And slowly but surely, the website started to show up in search results.  
**My manual SEO had worked.**

#### 💬 Reflection

This project didn’t just teach me about HTML, CSS, PHP, or SEO. It taught me how to:
- Manage unclear expectations,
- Communicate with non-technical clients,
- Ask the right questions,
- And trust the value of *iteration and learning on the go*.

It wasn't about the money. It was about building something real and watching it grow.

> Building your first project from scratch may feel like jumping off a cliff. But that’s exactly how you learn to fly.
