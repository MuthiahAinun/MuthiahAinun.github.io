> *"What is coding? Some people think it's hacking. I used to think so too."*

When someone sees a terminal full of text, their first guess is often: hacking.  
There are still people who assume coding means breaking into a system, as if we’re all modern-day spies.  
To some, even looking at code feels dizzying.

But the truth is: **coding is not scary** , it’s actually fun.  
It can be messy, frustrating, yet deeply rewarding.


#### 🚀 From Confused Beginner to Curious Explorer

Before I entered college, I knew nothing about IT, let alone coding.  
So why did I choose a major in Computer and Network Engineering, something completely outside my comfort zone?

**Because of the challenge.**

I’ve always believed that learning something you don’t know at all is more valuable than staying in your comfort zone.  
I didn’t know what an algorithm was, or how a “function” works.  
But as I began writing my first lines of code, practicing regularly, I started to understand the structure, the logic, and even how different languages behave.

Was it easy? Not at all.  
But that’s where the fun lies.


#### 🧩 Errors Are Not the Enemy - They’re Hidden Treasure

If I wrote perfect code every time, I wouldn’t grow.  
I’d be stuck using the same patterns, afraid to explore.  

But **errors force me to think**, to connect ideas, to really understand what the code is doing.

> I don’t hate errors, in fact, I treasure them.

They give me new knowledge, new perspective, and sometimes... even a breakthrough.

Yes, there were times I almost gave up.  
I cried.  
But crying didn’t solve anything, *sleeping did*.

I once dreamed about fixing an error and the crazy part is: it worked.  
Turns out that when the brain is too tired, it can’t see new possibilities.  
So I learned to rest, recharge, and come back with a clearer mind.


#### 🧠 Coding Trains the Mind — and the Heart

To me, coding is like a **mental game**.  
It trains my logic and my patience.  
It’s not about speed, it’s about clarity and endurance.

And no, you don’t have to be a genius to write algorithms.  
You just need to **be curious and keep learning**.

Through coding, I’ve learned more about myself:
- I’m a fast learner
- A pattern seeker
- And I deeply enjoy analyzing, more than typing


#### 💡 Why I Love Debugging

What I truly love is not the writing part, nor the success part, but the **thinking part**.

- Finding the bug  
- Tracing the logic  
- Understanding the *why* behind the error  

It’s like solving a mystery.

That’s probably why I love working with **data** too , because data is like chaos.  
Numbers, colors, randomness , waiting to be discovered.

And once you identify patterns, connect clues, and extract insights,  
it’s like unlocking a hidden door.

> It’s like being in a dark room, pressing buttons randomly 
> then suddenly, a window opens with a breathtaking view.


#### 🏁 Final Thought

Coding isn’t just for techies.  
It’s for thinkers, dreamers, and those who enjoy solving tiny puzzles with big impact.

It teaches you how to **handle frustration**, how to be **patient**, and how to **see beauty in structure**.

So if you ever feel stuck in your learning journey 
take a break, breathe, and come back.

Because when it finally works, it’s not just your code that grows, **you grow too**.
