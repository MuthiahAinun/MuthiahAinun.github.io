<p>
I am not here to be loud,<br>
but to leave a trace<br>
in thoughts, in stories, in silent data<br>
that whisper truths only the quiet can hear.
</p>

<p>
This space is not a monument,<br>
but a mirror of growth, of doubt,<br>
and of dreams stitched with learning and light.
</p>

<p>
Welcome to the intersection<br>
of logic and longing,<br>
of curiosity and creation.

<blockquote style="margin: 2em auto; font-style: italic;">
In the name of learning and sincerity:<br><br>

This site is a reflection <br>
of my pursuit of knowledge,<br>
of expression guided by values,<br>
and of beauty found in logic, light, and meaning.<br><br>

May everything I build here be of benefit,<br>
not only for today, but for what comes after.
